# SalpelloApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3. This is a very simple, basic TODO application by using angular cdk and bootstrap.
I've used local storage as the data source for my project and i populate data, upon the initilaization of the project.

You can checkout the live demo [here](https://laughing-chandrasekhar-f653b2.netlify.app/).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
